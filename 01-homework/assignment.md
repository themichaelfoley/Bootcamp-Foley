## Overview and Origin

* "[The Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org/) (SDF) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to create equitable access to the global financial system." (1) and have developed an open source network protocall to facilitate transactions between banks, payment systems, and individuals.(3) The method of payment utilizes their own cryptocurrency tokens called Stellar Lumens (XLM) which acts as the intermediary currency between partners.

* The SDF was founded in 2014 with the Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, former lawyer and Ripple CTO Joyce Kim, and in collaboration with the Stripe CEO Patrick Collison.(2)

* The idea of the Stellar network came about from the desire of the developers to create a "truly open source and decentralized" network (4) that could facilitate inexpensive cross-border payments to anyone. This was acheived through the use of open source code in the Stellar Consensus Protocol and publicly verifiable independent [validator nodes](https://stellarbeat.io/).(5)

* The SDF has received multiple rounds of funding starting with the initial seed investment of $3 million dollars from Stripe in 2014. Since then they have recieved over $50 million dollars from various companies including Google (4,6) and the remainder of their funding comes from the strategic sale of Lumens tokens which were created at the network's inception.(1)


## Business Activities:

* The current CEO Denelle Dixon had published the 2022 strategic roadmap for Stellar which includes three main components for the future. They are increased scalability and innovation, activating more network participation, and promoting inclusion in their vision of an equitable financial system. (8,9) 

* The SDF uses many elements of current blockchain technologies, but a specific financial problem they are working on, which happens to be one of the biggest problems plaguing the two largest blockchain networks, Bitcoin and Ethereum, is increasing the rate at which transactions can be processed. (17,18)  Stellar is developing their own decentralized exchange or "DEX" as a solution and have named the project [SPEEDEX](https://stellar.org/blog/building-speedex-a-novel-design-for-decentralized-exchanges?__hstc=17958374.2913812936ef96c84aa04ba0c2ce92f3.1637013292108.1637013292108.1637615841029.2&__hssc=17958374.1.1637615841029&__hsfp=56192259) (7) with the defined goal of "increasing transaction rate throuhput". This is done by using all available CPU's on the network and processing transactions in parallel rather than exclusivey in batches. The increased number of computers on the network will ultimately provide the scalability required for continued growth and adoption.

## Landscape:

* Stellar falls into Blockchain and Cryptocurrency domain of the broader financial industry, but the Stellar Development Foundation is engaged in many facets across the financial landscape that have shifted over the last decade. They are also involved in educational programs, cryptocurrency regulation, central bank digital currency (CBDC) development, and providing a foundation for developers to create smart contracts. (10,11,12)

## Results

* Stellar has made a partnership with MoneyGram to further enable their customers to have access to financial services.

* Denelle Dixon represented SDF at the US House Committee on Financial Services to discuss "digital assets, regulatory frameworks, environmental impact, and more." (12) 

* The Stellar network has been selected to create stablecoins for Argentina, Ukraine, and Brazil. (13,16)

* Year over Year growth (Q3 2020 to Q3 2021) for new accounts is up almost 6 million or 23.3%, total payments was up by almost 30 million or 149%, and overall netowrk operations are up over 219%. (14)

* The most common competitor comparison to Stellar due to similarities is Ripple, however Ripple does not support smart contracts, is currently removed from many exchanges. (15,16)


## Recommendations

* I would suggest that Stellar develop their own native Lumens Wallet and invest in local exchange infrastructure similar to Bitcoin ATM's. This could facilitate user growth and support for the netowrk could lead to a broader cryptocurrency adoption than what we have seen so far.
